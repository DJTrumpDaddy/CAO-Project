This project was brought to you by Declan Scott, Skylar Tesar, and Logan Wood.

The implementation for this project was straight forward:
	1. Create a module for a controller.
		- Although controllers are often separate parts of a computer, it is useful to combine the pieces as one module for simulation
		-The controller is a finite state machine that moves between states internally based on current state, but outputs based on current state and current input
	
	2. Create the SISC module for the CPU
		-This module had two jobs
			i. instantiate the other modules
			ii. wire the modules together

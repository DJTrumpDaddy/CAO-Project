**TODO**
- Implement new instructions (done!)
- Verify new and old instructions still work (done!)
- Write bubble sort program (done!)
- Write multiplication program (not started)
- update FSM diagram (not started)


***Notes***

General:
- New modules since P2 are mux16, dm

mux16:
output <= 16-bit address specifiying read and write address (only one is chosen within dm)
input <= when sel==0, 16 bits from ALU output (???WHICH PART OF ALU???) :: when sel==1, 16 bits from instruction
